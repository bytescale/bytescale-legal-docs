By continuing to use the Services after the new changes have taken effect, you indicate your agreement to the amended Terms of Service.

## 4. Service Fees

Bytescale offers free trials and paid plans.

For paid plans, you may pay the fees using one of the payment methods made available through the Service. Fees will be considered paid only after your payment has been confirmed. The Service will be available to you promptly after you have paid the Service fees.

From time to time, Bytescale may change the Service fees. If a fee change applies to the Service you are using, you will be charged the new fee from that point onwards.

Fees are not refundable.

Upon failure to make any payment, Bytescale may reduce the Services provided to you (including, without limitation, disabling downloads, disabling uploads, and disabling file transformations). Following seven (7) days after the first notice of the payment failure has been sent to you, Bytescale may disable or terminate your Bytescale account (see "Account Termination").

Bytescale will not be liable for mistakes made by the payment service providers: any excess payments will be refunded.

## 5. Account Termination

You have the right to terminate your account at any time by sending a cancellation request to Bytescale via email or by deleting your account via the settings page. We may suspend or terminate your account if we believe you are in violation of this Agreement and we believe an account-wide suspension or termination is the most prudent action to take considering all the factors involved. Bytescale may provide notice prior to account termination and may give you an opportunity to remedy such violations to avoid account termination (for example, if Bytescale believes the violation is accidental or not directly your fault).

Upon account termination: (i) you and your users shall cease use of the Services; (ii) Bytescale will cease providing the Services to you; (iii) you shall pay to Bytescale the full amount of any outstanding fees due; and (iv) Bytescale will delete all User Content that is stored on Bytescale's built-in storage, and will delete all User Content from the Bytescale CDN's cache at an arbitrary point in time after account termination, pursuant to Bytescale's internal scheduling.

## 10. Warranty Disclaimer

The Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Services are provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, satisfactory quality, availability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Bytescale will create any warranty not expressly stated herein.

Without limiting the foregoing, Bytescale, its processors, its providers, its licensors (and their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, directors, and employees) do not warrant that (i) the Services will be secure or available at any particular time or location; (ii) any defects or errors will be corrected; (iii) any content or software available at or through the Services is free of viruses or other harmful components; (iv) that the content will be secure or not otherwise lost or damaged; (v) that the Services will not harm your computer system; or (vi) the results of using the Services will meet your requirements. Your use of the Services is solely at your own risk. We do not have any obligation to verify the identity of users subscribing to our services, nor do we have any obligation to monitor the use of the Services by users. We disclaim all liability for identity theft or any other misuse of your identity or information.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

Bytescale and our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, suppliers, and agents will not be liable for any lost profits, data loss, cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, or special, indirect, incidental, punitive, compensatory or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever (including without limitation damages for lost profits, revenue, goodwill, use or content) (however arising), even if we had been advised as to the possibility of such damages, resulting from: (a) your use of the Services or inability to use the Services, (b) your access to or inability to access the Services, (c) the conduct or content of other users or third parties on or through the Services, (d) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of User Content, or (e) bugs, errors, viruses, trojan horses, or the like (regardless of the source of origination). In no event will Bytescale or our affiliates’ aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Services exceed the greater of (a) $100.00 USD or (b) the amount you paid Bytescale in the last 3 months for any Services.

These limitations and exclusions in this section (Limitation of Liability) apply to the maximum extent permitted by law even if (A) a remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose; or (B) we knew or should have known about the possibility of damages.

These Terms of Service set forth the entire liability of Bytescale and its affiliates as well as your exclusive remedy with respect to access and use of the Services.

## 12. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

### 12.1 Binding Arbitration

You and Bytescale agree that any dispute, claim or controversy relating in any way to this Agreement, the Services, your use of the Services, User Content, or to any products or services licensed or distributed by us will be finally settled through binding arbitration under the [LCIA Arbitration Rules](https://www.lcia.org/Dispute_Resolution_Services/lcia-arbitration-rules-2014.aspx), which are incorporated by reference into this clause. There will be one arbitrator (to be appointed by the LCIA), the arbitration will take place in London and the arbitration will be conducted in English. If you do not wish to agree to this clause, you must not use the Services.

### 12.2 Class Action Waiver

YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. Unless both you and we agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

### 12.3 No Opt Out Rights

You do not have the right to opt out of Section 12. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept this Agreement is to stop using the Services and to terminate your account.

## 13. Exclusive Venue

To the extent that this Agreement allows you or Bytescale to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Bytescale agree that all claims and disputes (whether contractual or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the courts of England in the United Kingdom, unless this is prohibited by the laws of the country where you reside. You and Bytescale consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.

## 14. Choice of Law

The laws of England and Wales govern this Agreement and any claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its subject matter. The courts in some countries may not apply the laws of England and Wales to some disputes related to this Agreement. If you reside in one of those countries, the laws of your home country may apply to those disputes.

## 15. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is found unenforceable, then that provision will be removed from the Agreement and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
