Service Level Agreement (SLA)
-----------------------------

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) formally guarantees at least 99.9% Uptime.

"Uptime" is the percentage of minutes in a Subscription Month that are not Downtime.

"Downtime" is a full minute of time where the Bytescale Dashboard, Bytescale API, or Bytescale CDN (the "Services") were unavailable for a reason that is not listed in the Exclusions.

"Subscription Month" is a month aligned with the customer's billing cycle with Bytescale.

"Scheduled Maintenance" means Bytescale's scheduled routine maintenance of the Services for which Bytescale notifies you at least seventy two (72) hours in advance. Scheduled Maintenance will not exceed eight (8) hours per month.

"Account Credit" is defined as a non-transferable discount applied to the next billing cycle.

## Compensation

In the event of less than 99.9% Uptime, but equal or greater than 99.0% Uptime for a given Subscription Month, the customer will receive an Account Credit equal to 20% of the amount charged for the Subscription Month, if a claim is filed by the customer in the next Subscription Month, and there are no outstanding charges at the time of the claim.

In the event of less than 99.0% Uptime for a given Subscription Month, the customer will receive an Account Credit equal to 40% of the amount charged for the Subscription Month, if a claim is filed by the customer in the next Subscription Month, and there are no outstanding charges at the time of the claim.

## Exclusions

The calculation of Downtime will not include unavailability to the extent due to:

- Use of the Services by the customer in a manner not authorized in the Bytescale Terms & Conditions or the applicable documentation;
- General Internet problems, force majeure events or other factors outside of Bytescale's reasonable control;
- The customer's or the customer's end users' equipment, software, network connections or other infrastructure;
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) outages verified by Amazon (verified AWS outages are reported here: https://health.aws.amazon.com/);
- Scheduled Maintenance.
