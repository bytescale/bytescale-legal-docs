It's important to note that We will always aim to inform You unless we are legally barred from doing so or if there is a definitive sign of illegal activity associated with the use of the Services.

## 7. Technical and Organizational Measures

We shall establish and uphold suitable technical and organizational measures (**"TOMs"**) to ensure Personal Data is Processed in accordance with this DPA, to offer assistance, and to safeguard Personal Data against a Personal Data Breach. These measures are detailed in Schedule B.

## 9. Compliance Audit

**9.1.** Subject to Sections 9.2 and 9.3, upon receiving a prior written request from You, We will provide a reputable auditor appointed by You in coordination with Us, such information to reasonably show compliance with this DPA. Furthermore, We will permit audits, including inspections, conducted by the appointed reputable auditor concerning Our Processing of Personal Data, on the condition that this third-party auditor adheres to confidentiality agreements.

**9.2.** Costs associated with providing information and conducting audits shall be at Your sole expense. Such activities may only be initiated under Section 9.1 if the Agreement does not already grant You rights to information and audits that satisfy the necessary criteria of the applicable Data Protection Laws. All audits or inspections must adhere to the terms of the Agreement and Our commitments to third parties, especially regarding confidentiality.

**9.3.** You are required to provide Us with reasonable advance written notification of any audit or inspection to be carried out under Section 9.1. You must use (and ensure that each of your appointed auditors use) their best efforts to prevent (or, if prevention is not possible, to minimize) any harm, injury, or disturbance to Our operations. The scope, timing, and duration of the audit or inspection, as well as the rate of reimbursement for which You will be accountable, shall be determined through mutual agreement between You and Us. We need not give access to Our premises for the purposes of such an audit or inspection:

1. If We were not given a written notice of such audit or inspection at least 2 weeks in advance;
2. Outside normal business hours at those premises;
3. To any individual, unless that person provides reasonable proof of their identity and authority;
4. To premises outside of Our control (such as datacenters managed by AWS, and other such premises operated by Our Sub-processors);

   1. You are required to conduct as per Data Protection Law, by a Supervisory Authority, or any similar regulatory authority tasked with enforcing Data Protection Laws in any country or territory, provided that You have specified your concerns or the relevant requirement or request in your prior written notice to Us about the audit or inspection.

**9.4.** You are obligated to compensate Us for any time spent on such audits, based on Our current rates at that time, which will be provided to You upon request. Prior to starting any such audit, You and We will jointly decide on its scope, timing, and length, along with the rate of reimbursement for which You will be liable. All rates for reimbursement must be fair, reflecting the resource and opportunity costs incurred by Us. You must immediately inform Us of any noncompliance found during an audit, and We will make commercially reasonable attempts to rectify any verified non-compliance.

## 10. Personal Data Breach Notification

**10.1.** In the event of a Personal Data Breach, whether actual or reasonably suspected, We shall:

1. notify You without undue delay upon becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach involving Us or a Sub-processor;
2. provide reasonable information, cooperation, and assistance to You regarding any measures to be undertaken in response to a Personal Data Breach under Data Protection Laws. This includes assistance concerning the communication of the Personal Data Breach to Data Subjects and national data protection authorities.

## 11. Sub-Processing

**11.1.** You agree to Our use of third-party Sub-processors to process Personal Data, as detailed in Schedule A. Should You have reasonable data protection concerns, You may object to Our selection or replacement of a Sub-processor before their appointment or replacement.
